Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. 
The project aims at predicting the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. 
The dataset was collected from : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset
This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

We created a few different machine learning models: 'LinearRegression', 'Decision Tree' & 'Random Forest';
and evaluated their performance.
